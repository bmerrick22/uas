# Software Development for Unmanned Aerial Systems

## About
This repository is a collection of programs related to my Software Development for UAS course. Unless indicated, each project was developed individually. There are specific necesary Python modules such as DroneKit and DroneKit_SITL that are required to ensure each program functions. Please refer to each program for the necesary additional packages
